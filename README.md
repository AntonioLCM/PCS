# Agent-based evacuation model based on lab42
## Overview
In this project our goal is to find a configuration of emergency arrows that leads to a faster evacuation compared to the current configuration of arrows. The pathfinding algorithm used in our evacuation model is the a* algorithm, the visualization of the simulation is done with mesa.
